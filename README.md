# ToyToVerilogSimple
Simple program that converts .toy to verilog file, that can be included.
This was created in order to avoid manually typing and coping the code
from .toy file to verilog friendly format. This program is not finished, it works
but has little to no error handling. It is to be used carefully and please
double check if everything is okay. For me worked fine, but it might not be
true for everyone.

## Usage
```
python3 toytoverilog.py

Enter filename with extension:test.toy
Your code
